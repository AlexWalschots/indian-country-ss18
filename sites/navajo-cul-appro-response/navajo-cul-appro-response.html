      <h1>Cultural Appropriation & Response</h1>
      <h3>Navajo Nation</h3>
	  <h4>Alex Walschots</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>Throughout the U.S., nobody is stranger the appropriation of other cultures. We see it in our halloween costumes, our sports teams, and even television shows/movies. With all of the examples that surrounds our daily life, many instances seem to pass right under our noses. One of the biggest, and yet most ignored, examples of cultural appropriation in the United States is within the fashion industry. From the runway to the hallway, people all throughout America are buying and selling items that include “native” patterns and “tribal” styles. Most big brand companies are completely unapologetic to this offense, and continue to make money off the objectification of Native American cultures. One of the most recent and publicized instances of this is the court case between the Urban Outfitters corporation and the Navajo Nation. </p>

		  <h3> (True) Traditional Navajo Clothing </h3>

		</figure>
		   <p> After all of the instances of false interpretation of Navajo styles, it is important to know the true form of dress, and the symbolism behind it. Though most members of the community wear contemporary and more westernized outfits on a daily basis today, but their traditional styles are still embraced during special events, rituals, etc. </p>
		   <p2> According to navajo-arts.com, the traditional women’s style consists of hand-spun “foot or knee-high moccasins, a pleated velvet or cotton skirt, a matching long-sleeve blouse, concho and/or sash belt, jewelry and a shawl.” (Navajo Clothing) Often times they would also wear two small blankets laced together with arm holes, commonly known as the “squaw-dress.” (Viklund, A.) Men’s material was often made of deerskin or Yucca fibers, and was used for shirts, leggings, moccasins, and blankets. The headdress that has been commonly worn is a leather cap, a simple cloth, or a headband. Both genders decorate themselves with turquoise and silver jewelry. </p>
		   <p> A quite important fact that is left unnoticed when understanding Navajo culture is that clothing plays a crucial role in their identity. Wearing certain traditional clothing is seen as a way of gaining recognition with their Great Spirit. It is not just a fashion choice, it is a spiritual duty. When fashion industries choose to deem certain patterns and styles as “Navajo” without any understanding of what that name truly represents, it becomes a personal insult to the communities’ identity. </p>

		 <p>Stated by the U.S. Department of the Interior, “The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-644) is a truth-in-advertising law that prohibits misrepresentation in marketing of Indian arts and crafts products within the United States. It is illegal to offer or display for sale, or sell any art or craft product in a manner that falsely suggests it is Indian produced, an Indian product, or the product of a particular Indian or Indian Tribe or Indian arts and crafts organization, resident within the United States. For a first time violation of the Act, an individual can face civil or criminal penalties up to a $250,000 fine or a 5-year prison term, or both. If a business violates the Act, it can face civil penalties or can be prosecuted and fined up to $1,000,000.” (The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990) </p>

		  <h3>What is Cultural Appropriation?</h3>

		 <p>Everyone has their own definition of what exactly “cultural appropriation” is, due to how wide of a spectrum the phrase covers. It is hard to encompass the sheer effect of appropriation within a sentence, but the explanation that seems to cover its entirety the best is given by Fordham University Professor Susan Scafidi. In her words, cultural appropriation is "taking intellectual property, traditional knowledge, cultural expressions, or artifacts from someone else's culture without permission." To elaborate: "This can include unauthorized use of another culture's dance, dress, music, language, folklore, cuisine, traditional medicine, religious symbols, etc. It's most likely to be harmful when the source community is a minority group that has been oppressed or exploited in other ways or when the object of appropriation is particularly sensitive, e.g. sacred objects." (Baker K.J.)</p>
		 <p2>Every year Native Americans fall victim to public shame and cultural objectification inside the very country they live in. Their voices are hushed with the overpowering excuses from the offenders, such as “we’re honoring you” and the simple “get over it.” But how is honor displayed as red-painted faces and plastic feathers? How is honoring a culture defining it as “savage,” and generalizing hundreds and hundreds of different communities into a single stereotype? Who can just “get over” generations of disrespect induced by these humiliating costumes and outlandish assumptions? Native Americans are not a brand, but media and fashion continue to include objectification in order to make more money. </p2>

		  <h3>Urban Outfitters vs. Navajo Nation</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <figure style="float: right; width: 35%; padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">
			<img src="images/flask.jpg" width="100%" />
			<figcaption>Image 3 - "UO Flask and Tee" (Dunne, C.) </figcaption>
		</figure>
		 <p>In the year 2012, American clothing company Urban Outfitters released a line of clothes and accessories under the label “Navajo” or “Navaho.” This was distributed to all of their subsidiaries, including the the equally as popular Anthropologie and Free People. The line included geometric patterns of navy blue, red, orange, and cream, and, if this statement was not enough to cause outrage, pairs of underwear labeled “Navajo Hipster Panty” were released as well as a flask for liquor. After all of the stereotypes connecting Native Americans with alcohol abuse, this turned into just some examples of the extreme distaste and ignorance that Urban Outfitters displayed. Without surprise, the Navajo Nation responded quickly to the appropriation, and filed a lawsuit against the company for using their name and displaying false information about Navajo culture. They directly claimed that Urban Outfitters violated the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990, and, with the violation of trademark, the lawsuit sought compensation. (Navajo Sues, 2012) </p>
		 <p2>In response to these claims, Urban Outfitters quickly fought back with claiming that the Nation does not in fact own their own name, and the prints used in their line have been ones used for decades. “The term ‘navajo’ is a common, generic term widely used in the industry and by customers to describe a design/style or feature of clothing and clothing accessories, and therefore, is incapable of trademark protection,” a court document stated. (Navajo Nation, 2016) Due to the fact that the Navajo did not take action when other companies were spreading their name for their products, they have, theoretically, “forfeited” their rights to the name. The big-brand company even used the term “culturally sophisticated” to reference their target audience that purchases the “Navajo” themed panties.</p2>

			<figcaption>Image 5 - "UO panty" (The Navajo Nation's Case) </figcaption>
		</figure>
		 <p>Eventually, after years of waiting and deliberating, this lawsuit came to a bittersweet conclusion on September 29, 2016. Urban Outfitters had won the case with their right to sell what they wish, but now, after considering the serious outrage, it was under the condition that the Navajo Nation educate the company on the true cultures and styles, and sell accordingly. </p>
		 <p2>“We are a proud nation with talented artisans, scientists, lawyers and professionals who together represent the Navajo Nation,” Navajo President Russell Begaye said during the case. “We believe in protecting our Nation, our artisans, designs, prayers and way of life.” (Navajo Nation, 2016) </p2>
		 <p>Prior as well as following the case, the conversation on culture appropriation did not cease. Boycotts broke out, and direct letters to the company grew. A prominent figure in the fight to end appropriation for the sake of fashion was Sasha Houston Brown, a member of the Sioux Nation. Her letter to the company, titled “An Open Letter to Urban Outfitters on Columbus Day,” went viral 1 year before they were officially sued. “Urban Outfitters Inc. has taken Indigenous lifeways and artistic expressions and trivialized and sexualized them for the sake of corporate profit,” Brown writes. “Your company also perpetuates the worst stereotype of Indians. This is theft of our very cultural identity, no less so than the theft of our traditional homelands that began with Columbus’ “discovery” of the Americas. On this day that America still celebrates as Columbus Day, I ask that do what is morally right and apologize to Indigenous peoples of North America and withdraw this offensive line from retail stores.” (An Open Letter, 2011) </p> 
		 <p2>As long as there are people such as Brown and Begaye who continue to fight for Native American rights, process will continue to be made. </p2>

		  <h5> <strong>Victoria's Secret Fashion Show</strong> </h5>
		  <p> Victoria’s Secret has always been known to ride the lines of appropriation when it comes to their lines included in their annual televised fashion shows, but one pair of lingerie that pushed themselves over the edge was back in 2012. Karlie Kloss, a well-known model that doubles as a VS “Angel” walked the runway in a full “native” headdress and overly-large turquoise beads. Not only was the Native American impersonation worn by a white female, but it was worn with only lingerie, to make the culture appear “sexy.” Naturally, Kloss and the company received huge social media backlash, and demanded it be taken off of the broadcast. Both apologized for the upset that it cost, and responded by removing all footage of her from the broadcast. (Adams, B) </p>

			<figcaption>Image 7 - "Dsquaw Bridal" (Canadian fashion) </figcaption>
		</figure>
		  <h5> <strong>#Dsquaw</strong> </h5>
		  <p> Canadian designers Dean and Dan Caten released a line for Milan Fashion Week 2015-16 which sparked major controversy. They said that they were inspired by "The enchantment of Canadian Indian tribes. The confident attitude of the British aristocracy. In a captivating play on contrasts: an ode to America's native tribes meets the noble spirit of Old Europe." (Canadian fashion) The clothing depicted a mixture of heavy fur coats to symbolize Canadian Native groups, and feathered dresses underneath a white colonial jacket. Owner of Urban Native Magazine Lisa Charleyboy said it best when he deemed the line “the glamorization of colonization.” The title in itself is an offense, using the Algonquin word for woman “squaw.” After the response it got from Native communities and well as the general public, the collection was taken down. </p>

			<figcaption>Image 8 - "Hipster Headdress" (H&M pulls) </figcaption>
		</figure>
		  <h5> <strong>H&M</strong> </h5>
		  <p> Similar to Urban Outfitters, H&M has been guilty several times for selling “Hipster Native” inspired collections, and their most infamous “Hipster Headdress” in 2013. This so-called headdress consisted of white and pink fake feathers glued atop a black-and-white patterned band. The product began to gain media attention when a member of the Ojibwe-Mohawk nation Kim Wheeler shared her thoughts to the company via email. “‘My first instinct was to buy all of them and throw them in the garbage. It's not honoring us. It's not flattering us. It's making a mockery of our culture. We just don't think it's cool,’ said the 44-year-old Wheeler, who lives in Winnipeg, Manitoba. ‘People in my community have kind of been fighting that whole 'hipster headdressing' for awhile now.’” (‘H&M pulls’) The product has since been pulled from shelves and online. </p>
